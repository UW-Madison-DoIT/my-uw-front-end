        NOTE:  The default skin for Respondr is available in two flavors:  dynamic and static.

          - 'dynamic' (enabled by default) requires the RespondrDynamicSkin portlet and 
            relies on it to link compiled LESS (i.e. CSS) into the page.
          - 'static' links compiled LESS (i.e. CSS) into the page automatically, in
            the traditional way, and MUST NOT be used with the RespondrDynamicSkin portlet.

        Both flavors use exactly the same LESS files.  The dynamic strategy supports
        changing a few settings (i.e. color choices) using an admin UI.  You can 
        switch from one strategy to the other in the defaultSkin/skin.xml file.

        BE SURE TO ADD/REMOVE THE 'dynamic-respondr-skin' PORTLET FROM THE 'respondr-lo'
        FRAGMENT LAYOUT (and re-import) AS APPROPRIATE.
